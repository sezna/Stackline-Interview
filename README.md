# Some Notes on my Implementation

I think most of this went well, but I did have to do a lot of pixel inspection to try to get the scaling, colors, and responsiveness right. I chose to leave some fragments of an async action request in there as well, so you can see that I am at least somewhat familiar with that, but as it was stated to not use a full API request (and also due to CORS), the actual implementation falls back on a "stubbed-out" API. I hope you enjoy! I look forward to hearing back from you.
